                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hey there! I'm Johnny Mai, a Full-Stack Developer and passionate software engineering student at Florida Gulf Coast University. Originally hailing from the vibrant city of Baltimore, Maryland, I've set my sights on making a meaningful impact in the world of machine learning and application development.</p>
                <p>My journey into software development is deeply rooted in a personal story. Growing up in a family that faced language barriers after immigrating from Vietnam to America, I witnessed firsthand the challenges and frustrations that come with linguistic differences. This experience ignited a fire within me to leverage technology as a solution to bridge these language gaps.</p>
                <p>With a burning passion for addressing real-world problems, I'm on a mission to create innovative software solutions that break down communication barriers and empower individuals from diverse backgrounds. Whether it's developing cutting-edge machine learning models or crafting user-friendly applications, I'm dedicated to making a positive impact through technology.</p>
                <p>Curious to learn more about my work? Feel free to explore my website and portfolio at <a href="https://johnny-mai7.github.io/johnnymai/">johnny-mai7.github.io/johnnymai</a>.</p>
